## Saloon B, the corner saloon (#848 step 1: the spec and the frame): built from its spec
## (experiments/building_lab/saloon_b/saloon_b.json) it is destructible through and through, stands,
## is built right, fits a man at every door, stair and use point, and every room has its people's
## places and its own lamp. It writes every member to build/saloon_b_members.json for the X-ray
## sheet (tools/buildings/xray.py).
