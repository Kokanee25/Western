# CLAUDE.md — working notes for Salt Creek (the Western)

Read **DESIGN.md** first: it's the source of truth for what the game is. Concept art is in
`docs/concept/`. This file is how we work.

## Who and how

- Sean directs; Claude builds. Sean works shifts and plays/reviews in short sessions, often from his
  phone, and tests builds on PC. Keep each session's work self-contained: leave the game runnable, and
  update **Status** at the bottom of this file before finishing.
- Tone of the game: grounded and gritty, with humour. When in doubt, systems over scripts.
- Decisions already made are in DESIGN.md. Don't reopen them without asking; open questions are
  listed in DESIGN.md §13.

## Tech decisions

- **Engine: Godot 4** (latest stable 4.x). Chosen because every script, scene and resource is plain
  text Claude can read and edit, it's free and open source, exports to Windows/Mac/Linux (Steam later),
  and runs headless for automated tests.
- **Language: GDScript** by default. Use C# only for a measured performance hotspot, and ask first.
- **Target: PC / big screen**, keyboard + mouse and controller. First person only.
- **Look:** render the 3D scene into a low-resolution SubViewport (start at 640×360) and scale it to the
  window with nearest-neighbour filtering; modern lighting (shadows, fog, volumetric light, glow) happens
  at the low resolution. Keep the internal resolution a setting.
- **AI characters:** called through a small relay server that holds the API key (OpenRouter, so the
  model can be switched). **The key never goes in this repo or in the game build.** The AI is only
  called for conversation, asynchronously — never inside the frame loop.
- **Asset pipeline: Blender, run headless by script** (`blender -b --python …`) in the cloud workspace.
  Most props and buildings are built in code (see DESIGN.md §4 and `src/structures/`); Blender is for
  what code does poorly. Scripts live in the repo (`tools/blender/`) so every step is repeatable: bodies
  and faces, fitting garments to body types, splitting bodies at joints with finished stumps, rigging
  and retargeting mocap, cleaning up any AI-generated models (decimate, fix normals/UVs/scale), and
  exporting glTF for Godot. Framing questions: ask Sean, he's a timber framer.
  Blender MCP (driving a live Blender window) is optional later, once Sean has a PC that can run it,
  for hands-on art-direction sessions.
- **External asset APIs** (Meshy for 3D, image models, voice services) are called with keys stored as
  environment secrets — never in the repo.
- **Saving:** only when the player sleeps in a bed. Save files store the difference from the authored
  town (broken members, debris positions, wounds, memories), per person where possible.

## Architecture guidelines

- Systems talk through small, explicit interfaces (signals / an event bus), so fire, structures,
  bodies, sound, witnesses and memory can react to each other without knowing each other's internals.
- Everything that should persist has an ID and a serialisable state.
- Simulation (bodies, fire, structures, schedules) runs on fixed timesteps and is testable without
  rendering.
- Put tunable numbers (bleed rates, burn rates, bone strengths, day length) in data resources, not code.
- Keep the anatomy, fire and structure systems deterministic enough to test: seedable randomness.

## Testing

- Unit/system tests run headless (`godot --headless` with a test runner such as GUT or gdUnit4).
  Every system gets tests for its rules (a femoral hit bleeds out in N minutes untreated; a beam with no
  load path collapses; fire spreads to dry siding but not stone).
- Visual checks: render screenshots from fixed camera views and compare them against the concept art
  in `docs/concept/`. When real-GPU rendering isn't available, say so rather than guessing.
- Sean reviews on PC. Tell him exactly what to try in each build.

## Build plan

Work in this order; each milestone ends playable. The first slice is defined in DESIGN.md §12.

1. **M0 — Project skeleton:** Godot project, low-res pixel pipeline, first-person controller (walk, look,
   crouch, controller support), a test street with one false-front building, day/night lighting.
2. **M1 — The gun:** single-action revolver (cock, fire, gate reload, black-powder smoke), hit traces.
3. **M2 — Bodies:** hidden anatomy, ballistics through tissue, physiology (blood, shock, pain, adrenaline),
   fear and surrender, visible wound decals and clothing layers, one test outlaw. **Prove the gunfight
   feels good here.**
4. **M3 — Structures:** member-based buildings with a support graph, breakage, collapse, persistent
   sleeping rubble; then fire spread; then dynamite.
5. **M4 — People:** routines, needs, memory records and opinions, witnesses and sound, then AI
   conversation (voice + suggested replies) through the relay.
6. **M5 — The town slice:** Salt Creek's first dozen people, the outlaw scenario with multiple endings,
   the doctor, the jail, saving in bed and waking at the doctor's.
7. **M6+ —** the sheriff opening, the railroad clock, the drama manager, the mine, the full cast.

## Commands and layout

Godot **4.7.2** (pinned in `.github/workflows/build.yml`; bump both together).

```sh
godot --headless --import                                      # after adding class_name scripts
godot --headless --fixed-fps 60 -s res://tests/run_tests.gd     # all tests (exit 1 on failure)
godot --headless --fixed-fps 60 -s res://tests/run_tests.gd -- --only=player   # one file or method
xvfb-run -a godot --path . --rendering-driver vulkan -s res://tools/screenshots.gd -- --out=/tmp/shots
godot --headless --export-release "Linux" build/linux/SaltCreek.x86_64         # needs export templates
```

- `src/autoload/` — `Events` (the event bus), `Settings` (user://settings.cfg), `Controls` (the input
  map, built in code: keyboard/mouse and controller).
- `src/main/main.gd` + `scenes/main.tscn` — the pixel pipeline: world renders in `GameViewport`
  (SubViewport at `Settings.internal_resolution`), drawn to `Screen` with nearest filtering.
- `src/player/` — controller, visible body, tuning resource (`config/player_tuning.tres`).
- `src/world/` — `DayCycle` (clock + sky; `config/day_cycle.tres`), sky and ground shaders, oil lamps,
  placeholder scenery.
- `src/structures/` — `Structure` + `StructureMember` (members with IDs, kinds, support tiers and an
  inferred support graph), `FalseFrontBuilding`, `Boardwalk`, `HitchingRail`, `WaterTrough`.
- `tests/` — tiny self-contained runner (no addon): `extends TestCase`, methods `test_*`, may `await`.
  A Logger turns any script error during a test into a failure.
- CI: every push runs tests; pushes to `main` export Windows/Mac/Linux to a Release (notes from
  `docs/BUILD_NOTES.md` — update it each milestone) and the web build to GitHub Pages.

## Status

- 2026-09-27: Design session done; DESIGN.md and concept art committed. No code yet. Next: M0.
- 2026-09-28: **M0 built** on Godot 4.7.2. Pixel pipeline (640×360 default, F2 cycles, integer-scale
  option in settings), first-person controller (walk/run/crouch/jump/look, mouse + controller + touch
  on web, visible body with shadow-only head/hat/arms), test street (dirt road, boardwalk, member-built
  false-front store with open door, counter, shelves and lamps, hitching rail, trough, blockout town,
  hills), 45-minute day with sun/moon/stars/lamps and T to speed up (1×/30×/180×). 38 headless tests
  pass (project, pixel pipeline, controller, day cycle, structure support graph, walk road→store).
  Exports for all four platforms verified locally.
  - Known placeholders: boardwalk edges are invisible ramps (controller has no step climbing yet);
    one full moon every night; blockout buildings and props are plain boxes; no audio.
  - Support graph is "resting on any lower-tier member" — enough for load-path checks, not for spans
    or cantilevers (the porch rafters hang on the ledger alone). M3 needs loads and strengths.
  - Reference renders (software Vulkan via lavapipe, so a real GPU may differ slightly):
    `docs/screenshots/m0/`. Re-render with `tools/screenshots.gd` and compare after lighting changes.
  - Next: Sean's review of the look and feel, then M1 (the revolver).
- 2026-09-28 (later): **Meshy art trial set up.** A member-built `SaloonBuilding` across the street
  is the art test room (bar, back bar, card tables, piano, stag head, sconces; brighter night ambient).
  Loose props come from `assets/props/manifest.json` via `PropLibrary`: `<id>.glb` if present (scaled
  to the manifest's real size, anchored to floor or wall, box collision), else a placeholder box.
  `tools/meshy_fetch.py` generates the GLBs from the manifest prompts (needs `MESHY_API_KEY` and
  meshy.ai allowed in the environment's network settings; untested against the live API so far).
  F5 / D-pad up jumps between places. 43 tests pass.
  - Next: get the 12 models (script or Sean uploads GLBs), render the saloon views, judge against
    `docs/concept/saloon-night.png`. Watch GLB sizes in git (2K textures add up; downscale if needed).
- 2026-09-28 (later): **Art direction clarified by Sean** (DESIGN.md §4 updated): "high-resolution
  Duke Nukem 3D in real 3D" — low-poly models with pixel-art textures, modern lighting, but realistic
  mocap animation + physics/active ragdolls, and people detailed down to finger bones. This makes most
  props and buildings doable from code (pixel textures authored in code); Meshy is optional now.
  - Next: a proof pass on the store (code-made pixel textures, texel density ~32–64/m), and Sean to
    pick the internal resolution (fingers need ~960×540+ to read at table distance).
- 2026-09-28 (later): **Pixel-texture proof done.** `src/art/pixel_art.gd` paints tileable 64×64
  pixel-art textures in code (wood grain along u, knots, checks, peeling paint, dirt), 3–5 shades per
  colour; `src/structures/member_mesh.gd` gives members UVs in metres with the grain along their
  length; all members, blockouts and the ground use 40 texels/m with nearest filtering; sign text is
  chunky pixel lettering. Renders in `docs/screenshots/pixel_textures/`. 47 tests pass.
  - Next: Sean's verdict on the look and resolution, then M1 (the revolver) — the gun can be the
    first detailed code-built model in the new style.
- 2026-09-28 (later): Sean: "still looks very smooth, not really pixel". Added three live look knobs:
  F2 render resolution, **F7 texel size** (`PixelArt.set_density`, presets 40/mip, 24, 16 texels/m;
  every grid material is tracked and updated live), **F6 pixel shading** (`src/render/pixel_screen.gdshader`
  on the Screen: per-channel levels + 4×4 Bayer dither in low-res pixel space; `Settings.pixel_shading`).
  `tools/screenshots.gd` takes `--texels= --nomip --shade --res=WxH --window --suffix=` for comparisons.
  49 tests pass.
  - Next: Sean picks a combination (renders suggested ~480×270 + 24/m + shading); make it the default.
- 2026-09-28 (later): Sean liked the starting look (640×360, 40 texels/m smoothed) before pressing F7.
  F7 texel size is now a saved setting like F2/F6 (`Settings.texels_per_meter`), each change flashes
  the look on screen (`Settings.look_description()`), and F3 lists all three. 50 tests pass.
  - Next: confirm Sean's exact combination (res + shading) and make it the default.
- 2026-09-28 (later): **Look approved.** Sean likes the default (640×360, 40 texels/m smoothed, shading
  off) and wants the graphics options kept switchable on the fly (F2/F6/F7, saved). Recorded in
  DESIGN.md §4. The options go into a settings menu when there is one.
  - Next: M1 — the single-action revolver, built in code in the new style.
- 2026-09-28 (later): **M1 — the revolver — built.** `src/weapons/`: `RevolverState` (pure rules:
  single action, 6 chambers carried 5-up, half-cock + gate + ejector reload one chamber at a time,
  seeded misfires, belt ammo, to/from dict), `RevolverTuning` (`config/revolver.tres`), `RevolverModel`
  (Colt SAA from parts in code: moving hammer/trigger/cylinder/gate/ejector, brass rims show loads),
  `HandModel` (right hand, 3 bones per finger), `RevolverViewmodel` (controls, poses hip/aim/loading/
  holster, recoil, firing). `src/ballistics/`: `Ballistics` flies bullets on the physics tick (travel
  time, drop), penetrates members by thickness × `config/ballistics.tres` J/cm, pushes rigid bodies;
  `StructureMember.add_hole()` records holes (saved in `to_dict`) and draws them with
  `member_holes.gdshader` (through-holes are cut out, so light passes). Effects: `GunSmoke`
  (lit particles + FogVolume), muzzle flash, splinters/dust, spent brass as rigid bodies that stay.
  `SynthSounds`: gunshot with hill echoes, clicks, brass — generated in code. Range at the east end
  (target board + backstop, tin cans), F8 bullet traces, touch buttons for the gun. 70 tests pass.
  Renders in `docs/screenshots/m1/`.
  - Known gaps: hand is blocky (proper hands come with M2 anatomy); no left hand (rounds slide in
    by themselves); no fouling yet; glass takes bullets but doesn't show holes or shatter (M3);
    nobody to shoot yet (M2).
  - Next: Sean's feel review of the gun, then M2 — bodies.
